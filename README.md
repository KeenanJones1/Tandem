Trivia app that displays questions with multiple-choice answers to select from. The player can view the question, the answer chosen, the correct answer, and their score. I used React.js and Node.js, If unfamiliar with Node or react. Please navigate to the "TandemTrivia" directory and run "npm start" to start the applcation. 
The difficulty I ran into was shuffling the answers to each question, every correct answer is in the same place, in the mulitple choice structure. Very enjoyable challenge Thank you!
